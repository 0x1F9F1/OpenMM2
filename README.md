# OpenMM2

OpenMM2 is an open source re-implementation of Midtown Madness 2.

This project is a bottom-up rewrite of Midtown Madness 2,
using the original binary to provide functions that have not been implemented yet.
The intention is to allow the fixing of bugs, implementation of new
features and porting to platforms unsupported by the original.
